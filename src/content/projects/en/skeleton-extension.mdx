<TextBlock title="Behind this project">I wanted to create a package to auto-inject colors to HTML elements, instead of doing it by hand. This is a simple functionality, but really useful for speeding-up the process of designing and developing HTML/CSS layouts, catch layout issues and misalignments easily, and even see how your favorite websites layout html elements. This plugin initially started as an npm package that injected CSS classes into your project, but ended up being more convenient to have it just as plugin in the browser so you do not have to add dependencies into your JavaScript projects.</TextBlock>
