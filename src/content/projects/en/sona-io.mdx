<TextBlock title="Behind this project">This web app is designed to make local music more accessible — helping users discover nearby events and instantly connect with artists through their music. It also provides independent artists with a space to reach local audiences and promote their shows, bridging the gap between digital streaming and live performance.</TextBlock>
<Video src="/assets/projects/case-study-2/video-2.mp4" title="Learn more about artists you're interested in by listening to more of their music and seeing who they'll be performing with and where." />
<TextBlock title="Next Steps">While this project currently exists as a Figma prototype, it lays the foundation for a full-featured web application focused on local music discovery. The next steps include refining the UI to cover edge cases, improving mobile responsiveness, and finalizing the visual system. Once the design is complete, I plan to implement the front-end using modern frameworks, followed by a scalable back-end with user accounts, music playback, and event management. Features like artist uploads, ticket links, and API integrations for venue data will be explored as the product evolves.</TextBlock>
